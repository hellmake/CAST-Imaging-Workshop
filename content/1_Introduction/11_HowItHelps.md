- Pinpoint cloud migration Blockers with estimated effort to remediate them as well as cloud migration Boosters that can be leveraged
- Identify suitable AWS services that are good candidates to utilize given your application technology stack
- Detect Open Source security vulnerabilities (CVEs), licensing risk (CopyLeft) and obsolescence components
- Mitigate that risk by getting automated recommendations for safer versions to adopt and generate the Software Bill of Materials
